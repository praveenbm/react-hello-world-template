React Hello World Template
========
I'm always looking for ways to **Skip To The Good Bitâ„¢**.

This is a starter template to quickly bootstrap new React projects without trying to copy one of your old setups or re-configuring webpack for the millionth time.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have npm & Node installed.

2. If you haven't already, install Babel, webpack and the webpack dev server:
```Shell
$ npm install babel webpack webpack-dev-server -g
```

3. Now clone this repo, install the starter packages and kick your server into action!
```Shell
$ git clone git@github.com:twilkinson573/react-hello-world-template.git <project-name>
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

4. Go to `localhost:8080` in a web browser and your app will be waiting for you. Any changes you make will be hot reloaded in the browser.

That's it!

Enjoy writing your delicious reusable React components!
